msgid "Copy is the command entered in a Linux shell to copy a file from one place to another, possibly on a different file system. The original file remains unchanged, and the new file may have the same or a different name. Copy is the command which makes a copy of your files or directories. The ways files are copied in Linux depend on your distribution and file system. All versions of Linux could copy files from the command line. There are also a number of file managers both text based and GUI that could be used."
