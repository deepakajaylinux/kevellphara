msgid ""
"Newrelic used to monitoring the server. Collaboration across the different "
"roles delivers many benefits. The combination of a shared code base, "
"continuous integration, test-driven techniques and automated deploys, among "
"other things, expose problems, in application code, infrastructure or "
"configuration, earlier because the software isn’t “thrown over the wall” to "
"Operations at the end of coding. Automated deployments and standardized "
"production environments, key aspects of DevOps, make deployments predictable"
" and free people from routine repetitive tasks to go do more creative "
"things. The newrelic is comfortable with Ubuntu and cent OS."
