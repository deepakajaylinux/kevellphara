"PHPEclipse is a set of plug-ins for the Eclipse Framework which provides "
"integrated IDE for PHP developers. Eclipse and PHPEclipse are written in "
"Java, and will run on all graphical desktop environments. PHPEclipse is Open"
" Source software, freely available under the Common Public Licence."

"The Eclipse Platform provides users with a consistent user interface "
"paradigm. A software development IDE is one of the more complex desktop "
"applications most of us are likely to use, and so the time required for a "
"developer to become efficient with a particular IDE can be significant. "
"Eclipse doesn't reduce this time, but it does provide a consistent interface"
" approach which need only be learnt once in order to develop efficiently "
"with a wide range of programming languages and tools. As part of this "
"approach, Eclipse provides detailed documentation and tutorials on all its "
"generic functionality, allowing plugin projects, such as PHPEclipse, to "
"focus only on their areas specific to their domain. By learning to use "
"Eclipse as a development platform, or learning to develop your own plug-in "
"tools for eclipse, you are acquiring a useful and flexible skill."
