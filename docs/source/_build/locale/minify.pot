msgid "Minify is the removal of unnecessary characters from source code. Mini, when used as a prefix, means small.  The goal of minify is to make source code \"smaller\" and improve performance."

msgid "The term minify is often associated with interpreted scripted languages, such as php, that are deployed and transmitted over the Internet. Code that has been minified by replacing runs of spaces by a single space, for example, is more lightweight and takes less time for a browser to load. Popular minify tools for Web development include Compressor, and ubuntu Compiler. Minify suits to work with Ubuntu and cent OS."

msgid "Minify makes package development a breeze: Conceptually, minify is similar to compression.  Unlike code that has been compressed, however, code that has minified can still be worked with without requiring the extra step of decompression. Minified source code may also be used as a kind of obfuscation, though the term obfuscation may be distinguished as a form of false cryptography while a minified code instance may be reversed using a pretty-printer."
