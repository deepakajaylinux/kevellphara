"Oracle module used to update oracle. It is the first database designed for "
"enterprise grid computation, the most flexible and cost effective way to "
"manage information and applications. Enterprise grid computing creates large"
" pools of industry-standard, modular storage and servers. With this "
"architecture, each new system can be rapidly provisioned from the pool of "
"components. There is no need for peak workloads, because capacity can be "
"easily added or reallocated from the resource pools as needed. It is "
"comfortable with Ubuntu and Cent OS."
