Plugins are available for integrating Jenkins with most version control systems and big databases. Many build tools are supported via their respective plugins. Plugins can also change the way Jenkins looks or add new functionality. Builds can generate test reports in various formats supported by plugins (JUnit support is currently bundled) and Jenkins can display the reports and generate trends and render them in the GUI."
