Dapperstrano
==================

Synopsis
-------------

The dapperstrano envelops the applications of the users with automated deployment, build and release functions, web App versioning and infrastructure by code in PHP.

In order to build for well-deployment, many files are needed to be copied from FTP or other ad hoc solutions. And also lot of Enterprise Automation tools were missing. In order to overcome these shortages dapperstrano under the pharaoh tool were build up. PHP has dapperstrano just as ruby fiils the gap in Capistrano.

This tool is for provisioning applications and builds to your boxes. The user can set up even simple or complex application deployment pattern to their system with one or two PHP files Or, quickly setup cloud friendly deployment patterns.

Dapperstrano is modular, object oriented and extendible. So if the user requires any extra modules they can create and add the new modules based on their requirements.

This dapperstrano acts as a wrapper where all the steps of user deployment get covered into a single file. This allows using a single command to fire up an instance of your applications.
