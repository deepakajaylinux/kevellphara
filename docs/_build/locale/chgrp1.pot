Each user on the system, including the root user, is assigned his or her own group of which he or she is the only member, ensuring access only by that user.

Most administration files, like configuration files in the /etc directory, are owned by the root user and belong to the root group. Only the root user has permission to modify them, whereas normal users can read and, in the case of programs, also execute them"
