"This module assists the users to install the latest version of SVN in "
"Ubuntu. Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after the command name "
"svn) is a software versioning and revision control system distributed as "
"free software under the Apache License.[1] Developers use Subversion to "
"maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web "
"pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to"
" the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Let us see how this "
"module facilitates in installing, uninstalling, ensuring the subversion in "
