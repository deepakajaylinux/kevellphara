"Jetty is a pure Java-based HTTP (Web) server and Java Servlet container. "
"While Web Servers are usually associated with serving documents to people, "
"Jetty is now often used for machine to machine communications, usually "
"within larger software frameworks. Jetty is developed as a free and open "
"source project as part of the Eclipse Foundation. The web server is used in "
"products such as Apache ActiveMQ, Alfresco, Apache Geronimo, Apache Maven, "
"Apache Spark, Google App Engine, Eclipse, FUSE, Twitter's Streaming API and "
"Zimbra. Jetty is also the server in open source projects such as Lift, "
"Eucalyptus, Red5, Hadoop and I2P. Jetty supports the latest Java Servlet API"
" (with JSP support) as well as protocols SPDY and WebSocket."
