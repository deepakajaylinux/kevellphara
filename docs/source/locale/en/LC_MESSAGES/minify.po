"Minify is the removal of unnecessary characters from source code. Mini, when"
" used as a prefix, means small.  The goal of minify is to make source code "
"\"smaller\" and improve performance."

"The term minify is often associated with interpreted scripted languages, "
"such as php, that are deployed and transmitted over the Internet. Code that "
"has been minified by replacing runs of spaces by a single space, for "
"example, is more lightweight and takes less time for a browser to load. "
"Popular minify tools for Web development include Compressor, and ubuntu "
"Compiler. Minify suits to work with Ubuntu and cent OS."

#: ../../minify.rst:15
msgid ""
"Minify makes package development a breeze: Conceptually, minify is similar "
"to compression.  Unlike code that has been compressed, however, code that "
"has minified can still be worked with without requiring the extra step of "
"decompression. Minified source code may also be used as a kind of "
"obfuscation, though the term obfuscation may be distinguished as a form of "
"false cryptography while a minified code instance may be reversed using a "
"pretty-printer."
